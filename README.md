"# Telescope Group Project Cluster 3" 
# IMPORTANT

This repo should only contain codes and any Observation data should be hosted locally. <br>
You could add the observation data folder into the same file path where your cloned code is, and edit the .gitignore file so that it ignore that data folder (espescially important if you use different name for your data folder).
